These signs that we follow are called wayfinding systems.</p><h4>Let's get deeper into the wayfinding systems which airports need to think deeply in the concept.</h4><ul><li>they offer a comprehensive and understandable list of general locations which people can visit.</li><li>they provide needed detail about what's in these locations.</li><li>they are highly contextual.</li><li>as we navigate deeper into the system they become more specific.</li><li>they help people to orient themselves by clearly highlighting their current location relative to other locations.</li><li>they provide a clear exit path.<ul></ul></li></ul><p>What Mike means is that your app's interface is really just one big old wayfinding system.</p><h4>You may go through your app, one screen at a time, and ask yourself, does every screen help:</h4><ul><li>people to know where they are?</li><li>providing options to people to tell them where else they can go?<ul></ul></li></ul><p>Next principle is feedback, Mike switched to cars, because they're great way for us to learn about the design principle of feedback Forms of feedback in cars: - status feedback, let us know how the car is doing - completion feedback, let us know whether the actions we've performed are completed successfully or failed - warning feedback, to tell us about potential problems - error feedback, let us know when something we've tried to do has caused an error Now let get deeper in these feedback by their examples in cars and apps: 1. Status - like gears, fuel level and current speed</p><p align="center">

</p><p>​ These cues are discrete, and they're non-invasive, but they are hard to ignore and they provide necessary reassurance that our devices are performing as expected.<br>​<br>3. Warnings<br><br> - low fuel, low oil.<br><br> <img src="/AppleDesignPrinciples/lowfuel.png" alt="lowfuel" style="zoom:33%;" /><br><br><br> They help people to understand in advance about potential errors.<br><br>4. Errors - If you try to start a car without gas, you'll get an error message.<br><br></p><p align="center">

  </p><p>It's best to help people avoid getting errors, here in the Thing3 app if you type in the date June 31st, which does not exist, the app doesn't throw up an error or showing a warning; instead it automatically corrects the date and helps users not to get a validation error.<br><br></p><p align="center">

</p><h4>Feedback answers these questions:</h4><ul><li>what can I do?</li><li>what just happened?</li><li>what's happening?</li><li>what will happen in the future?<ul></ul></li></ul><p>Imagine yourself sitting in front of somebody who hasn't used your app. Let them work with your app and then describe the app, guide them along, explain to them what's happening, and what they should be paying attention to. Let them use the app again. Now consider how what you've said might differ from what the app is communicating. In Mike's experience, when someone needs to explain the design, it's usually more clear that the design itself. What people tell, fills in the gaps that are left by their design.<br><br>The next design principle is related to feedback, and that is the principle of visibility, which I'll cover in the next episode.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/tech-diarios">tech diarios</a></li><li><a href="/tags/apple">apple</a></li><li><a href="/tags/designprinciple">design-principle</a></li><li><a href="/tags/feedback">feedback</a></li></ul></article></div></body></html>
