Or consider the navigation in the Clock app, what if that was hidden in the hamburger menu.</p><p align="center">

</p><p>It seems obvious. But there's a trade off here and we should be careful because densely packed interfaces can be overwhelming and they can slow decision making, especially for people who are new to your app.</p><h2>Consistency</h2><p>This principle is about representing similar design features in similar ways. You expect the brake to be on the left, and the accelerator to be on the right. It is because of consistency in cars, that we don't have to learn how to drive a car every time we get a new car.</p><p>Mike then started to talk about two famous icons for share button:</p><p align="center">
<img src="/AppleDesignPrinciples/share-buttons.png" style="border-radius:5%">
</p><p>He said using the right icon which is used on websites and other platforms seems to be rational, but not the right call; Because it is the best to be consistent with the symbol that the user is most familiar with.</p><p>As it may have occurred to your mind, there's always the impulse to do things a little bit differently, and this is a really good thing because this is how innovation happens.</p><p>There's another consistency, called internal consistency which is about designing controls to share a similar look and feel that match each other; for example Text in your app should have a limited number of font faces and colors. Internal consistency gives people a deeper sense of product integrity.</p><h2>Grouping</h2><p>Now grouping, let's talk about light switches in a room. Obviously the bathroom light switch is in the bathroom, the hallway light switch is in the hallway and the bedroom light switch is in the bedroom. Greater proximity also makes ergonomic sense.</p><p>In general the closer you are to an object or region of interest, the more likely you are to want to interact with it and control it.</p><p>If in the hallway, they're switches for light and shade, it would be better to seperate shade out from rest.</p><p align="center">
<img src="/AppleDesignPrinciples/light-switches.png" style="border-radius:3%">
</p><p>Let's see some examples in apps:</p><ul><li>Sketch: Transform and editing tools, path finding operations and the layer ordering actions are grouped to cluster related controls with each other.</li></ul><p align="center">
  <img src="/AppleDesignPrinciples/sketch.png" style="border-radius:15%">
  </p><h2>Mapping</h2><p>Mapping is about designing the controls to resemble the objects that they affect.</p><p>The progress bar here indicates the size of the text and makes you wonder how to control the size of the ABC.</p><p align="center">
<img src="/AppleDesignPrinciples/progressbar.png" style="border-radius:4%">
</p><h2>Affordance</h2><p>In my dictionary, affordance is the quality or property of an object that defines its possible uses or makes clear how it can or should be used.</p><p>Imagine a Frisbee, our notion about how we interact with this Frisbee, which is not an attribute of the object itself, it is more about the relationship that individuals have to an object.</p><p>For example a Frisbee affords Mike with a possibility of catching and throwing, but for his dog it's just catching.</p><p>Manufactured objects include cues to evoke affordances. They let people know what actions are possible and help people to know the correct or the intended ways of interacting.</p><p>Buttons afford tapping.(same in apps and physical keyboards) The button after all is just a highly abstracted version of a real world button. And my favourite is tapping on the weather app, we see it slides up a little bit. This suggests the possibility that the contact areas can be scrolled.</p><p>Let's get a break with another term here: "Progressive disclosure" is a technique for moving from abstract to specific. MIke got his own example:</p><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2813">He then asks what kind of</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2814">cheese, cheddar, Swiss, Jack,</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2815">Gruyere, cottage?</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2817">"Cheddar," I say.</a></p><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2819">He then asks whether I would</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2820">like bacon, egg, avocado on it?</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2823">"None," I say.</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2825">I am trying to keep my figure.</a></p><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2828">He then asks whether I'd like</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2829">salad, fries or onion rings.</a></p><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2832">"Onion rings," I say.</a></p><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2834">He then asks if I realize that</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2835">cheeseburgers and onion rings</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2836">are very high in calories, to</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2838">which I reply, "Fake news"</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2840">.</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2841">This in a nutshell is</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2852">the principle of progressive</a><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017-802/?time=2854">disclosure.</a></p><p>Assume that Mike wants a cheeseburger but if he knew that the restaurant has pepperoni, he would have gotten them. Progressive disclosures can also bury the information.</p><p>Well, discussions about how to properly use progressive disclosure often come down to the 80/20 rule which says 80 percent of a system's effects comes from 20% of its causes.</p><p>For an app, this might mean that 80% of it's benefits come from 20% of its actions. Lets take a look at the print section in the preview app.</p><p align="center">
<img src="/AppleDesignPrinciples/print-menu.png" style="border-radius:5%">
</p><p>What the user needs most of the time is how many copies, which printer they want, or what pages need to be printed.</p><h2>Symmetry</h2><p>Types of symmetry:<br><br></p><p align="center">
<img src="/AppleDesignPrinciples/symmetry-types.png" style="border-radius:2%">
</p><p>Symmetrical forms are efficient forms, and we tend to associate them with good health, stability, balance, and orderliness. We consider them aestherically pleasing, probably for very good evolutionary reasons. Every type of plant or animal, deonstrates one or more types of symmetry.</p><p align="center">
<img src="/AppleDesignPrinciples/symmetric-flower.jpg" style="border-radius:10%">
</p><p>And most human made objects do so as well.<br><br></p><p align="center">
<img src="/AppleDesignPrinciples/symmetric-car.jpg" style="border-radius:10%">
</p><p>The design principles express fundamental truths about human perception and cognition. They are simple, but powerful reminders aboute the true nature and purpose of design</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/tech-diarios">tech diarios</a></li><li><a href="/tags/apple">apple</a></li><li><a href="/tags/designprinciple">design-principle</a></li><li><a href="/tags/mapping">Mapping</a></li><li><a href="/tags/grouping">Grouping</a></li><li><a href="/tags/consistency">Consistency</a></li><li><a href="/tags/visibiity">Visibiity</a></li></ul></article></div></body></html>
